					<h2>About Allen</h2>
					<p>I was born in St.Paul in 1997. I went to Roseville highschool and spent majority of my time training for football. I was a running back and trained/worked out 6 days a week 2-3 times a day. I enjoyed training and primarily lifting weights
					   I was one of the strongest kid's in our class with my bench press hitting 290lbs and squat hitting 405 lbs when I was 15 years old. I burned out on football and unfortunately never went on to play in college.</p>
			 		<p>I was always interested in cars throughout highschool and decided to proceed with a career in diesel mechanic's. I graduated from Universal Technical Institute and went out into the work force. I worked a couple jobs until I found
					   Canadian Pacific Railroad which is where I have worked for over 4 years. After viewing how this industry works I have decided it is not something I want to continue to persue and am now enrolled in school in addition to working full time.
					   I am working towards a degree in programming and software to hopefully soon make my career transition towards a better life.</p
